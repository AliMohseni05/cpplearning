# Conditional statements
  //The if statement allows you to run a specified code if a given condition is true.

  if(condition) {
  //code to run
}

  The following comparison operators may be used to form the condition:

  &lt; less than

  &gt; greater than

  != not equal to

  == equal to

  <b>&lt;=</b> less than or equal to

  &gt;= greater than or equal to
  

You can check for a condition using the if statement.
In case the condition is false, the code in an else statement can be executed.
Here is a generic structure of&nbsp;if-else statements:

if(condition) {
  //some code
} 
else if(condition) {
//some other code
} 
else {
  //some other code
}
